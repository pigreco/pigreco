I am the founder of [Pigrecoinfinito](https://pigrecoinfinito.com/) and [HfcQGIS](https://hfcqgis.opendatasicilia.it/) and author of several open-source learning resources. The technologies I primarily work with are **QGIS**, **GDAL**, **SpatiaLite**, **PostgreSQL/PostGIS**. I am strong believer in open-source, open-data and open-learning materials.
